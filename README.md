##Description of Application:
This web application is a small website designed for a small investor who has recently _opened_ a new private island resort. The site features a homepage, as well as 3 other pages including; Applications, Activities, and Accommodations. This site will be used to advertise to people as well as guide them through making reservations and eventually renting the island out.
There are built in animations and hover effects to improve user experience. 
Within the project there are 2 different branches; those being 'main' and 'Dark-mode.' Main is the standard version of the website while Dark mode is a secondary version of the site with reassorted and inverted colors with the intention of making the website darker and have less contrast in certain areas. Both of these branches are meant to be options for the investor to choose.
