# Resort-website: Short summary: This is a small website for a small investor for a private island resort. It has 4 different webpages, with a homepage and 3 others dedicated to Accommodations, Activities, and Arrangements hosted at the resort. <> Known bugs: This site is NOT responsive. It was not designed to shift to differing screen sizes. For testing purposes I reccommend having the browser at 1300x1080px. <> This site features two different branches, those being main and Dark-mode.
